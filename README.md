android-forkbomb
================

This is a proof-of-concept that shows how a really simple implementation of a fork-bomb can currently immediately blocks any Android device.

The included APK will not start itself at boot, so it is fairly easy to be uninstalled (after the reboot :-))

For any questions, fell free to drop us an email.
